- Viterbi is an algorithm for searching the most probable sequence of hidden states based on the observation sequence.
- Please note that Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm, not aÂ greedy algorithm.
- For more details on this algorithm, you can just refer to the following websites:
