# Viterbi
Implementation of Viterbi algorithm

- Viterbi is an algorithm for searching the most probable sequence of hidden states based on the observation sequence.
- Please note that Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm, not aÂ greedy algorithm.
- For more details on this algorithm, you can just refer to the following websites:
  - https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%BB%B4%E7%89%B9%E6%AF%94%E7%AE%97%E6%B3%95
  - http://www.52nlp.cn/hmm-learn-best-practices-six-viterbi-algorithm-2
- In this project
  - You can input an observation sequence(3 observation states are provided: obs1 obs2 obs3) with no length restrictions
